League champion viewer for Android - live from web

This app is a cancelled project for now. It was a live updater for League of Legends champion information. It connects to Riot's website, parses the html on the page to dynamically create a list of the latest champions and their lore.


Currently very buggy and broken. It was just an attempt to get myself experience with using data and creating a custom look for an app.
